Hi I'm Oliver.

I'm an electronic engineer firstly, and a programmer secondly (sorry). 

I mostly write Python, and a bit of C# or embedded C. 
My code probably isn't as elegant as a CompSci or SoftEng specialist, 
but I tend to comment and document my code more than your average bear.
I come from a background where compile-test-fix-recompile has a 6-10week 
cycle, so it pays to get it right first (okay, second) time round.
